# This is my first post

New deep learning models are introduced at an increasing rate and sometimes it’s hard to keep track of all the novelties. That said, one particular neural network model has proven to be especially effective for common natural language processing tasks. The model is called a Transformer and it makes use of several methods and mechanisms that I’ll introduce here. The papers I refer to in the post offer a more detailed and quantitative descriptio

## An Introduction to Transformers and Sequence-to-Sequence Learning for Machine Learning

New deep learning models `are` introduced at an increasing rate and sometimes it’s hard to keep track of all the novelties. That said, one particular neural network model has proven to be especially effective for common natural language processing tasks. The model is called a Transformer and it makes use of several methods and mechanisms that I’ll introduce here. The papers I refer to in the post offer a more detailed and quantitative descriptio
