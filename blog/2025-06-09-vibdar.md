ðŸŽ‰ **Vibdar Has Launched!** ðŸŽ¶

After months of building, testing, and playlist-vibing, I'm thrilled to announce the public launch of **[Vibdar.com](https://vibdar.com)** â€” a community-powered platform to discover and share Spotify playlists by vibe, not algorithm.

In a world where music discovery is dominated by opaque algorithms and walled-off apps, Vibdar flips the script. No login required. No guessing games. Just vibes â€” curated by real people who love music.

Vibdar is built on a simple idea:  
> _Good music shouldnâ€™t be hidden behind follower counts or algorithmic silos._

### ðŸ”¥ Join the Movement

Vibdar is live on **[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/vibdar-share-playlist-with-the-world)** and Iâ€™d love your support!  
Try it out. Share your favorite playlists. Give feedback. Help shape the future of music discovery.

Letâ€™s vibe together â€” at [vibdar.com](https://vibdar.com)

ðŸ“£ **P.S.** If youâ€™ve got a killer playlist, tag it and submit it. You might just help someone find their new favorite soundtrack.
